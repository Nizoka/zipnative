/**
 * zipnative — Sample regression gate (v1.1.0)
 * ============================================
 * Fingerprints every generated sample and compares the result to the
 * committed baseline, so a change anywhere in the engine that alters
 * existing output is caught before it ships.
 *
 * The baseline is a CHAIN, not a snapshot of the current tree. Each entry
 * records the release whose output its hash is (`since`) and keeps it across
 * every later rebaseline that leaves the sample alone, so 1.1.0 is still held
 * to the bytes v1.0.0 emitted, 1.2.0 will be held to 1.1.0's, and so on. An
 * entry whose hash is deliberately re-anchored moves to the release doing the
 * re-anchoring, which is what makes it visible in review. A sample introduced
 * by the release under development has no earlier reference, so it is
 * reported but does not fail — pass `--strict` to require it to be baselined
 * in the same pull request.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run test:generate                        # populate test-output/
 *   npm run verify:samples                       # compare against the baseline
 *   npx tsx scripts/verify-samples.ts --update   # rewrite the baseline
 *   npx tsx scripts/verify-samples.ts --strict   # also fail on new samples
 *   npx tsx scripts/verify-samples.ts --json     # machine-readable report
 *
 * (PowerShell swallows a bare `--`, so call the script directly when passing
 * flags rather than `npm run verify:samples -- --update`.)
 *
 * The fingerprinting itself lives in `scripts/lib/sample-fingerprint.ts`,
 * shared with the vitest gate at `tests/regression/samples.test.ts` so both
 * agree on what "unchanged output" means.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — every sample matches the baseline (or --update rewrote it)
 *   1 — a fingerprint changed, a sample vanished, or a new sample is not in
 *       the baseline under --strict
 *   2 — bad usage, or test-output/ is empty (run test:generate first)

 * emitted. A sample whose hash changed is being re-anchored, and its `since`
 * moves to the version under development: the reference is no longer the
 * older release's, and saying otherwise would hide the re-anchoring in a
 * one-line diff instead of surfacing it for review. Samples appearing for the
 * first time are stamped the same way, having no earlier reference at all.
